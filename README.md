<h1>Mark Manager</h1>
<p>This is a project for students that don't want to take their marks on paper. I'll try to make the releases compiled to executable</p>

<p>The Desk Version of the Project gives you opportunities like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>different subjects</li>
    <li>Average Calculation</li>
</ul>
