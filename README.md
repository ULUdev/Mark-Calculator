<h1>Mark Manager</h1>
<p>This is a project for students that don't want to take their marks on paper. I'll try to make the releases compiled to executable</p>
<h1>Desk</h1>
<p>The Desk Version of the Project gives you opportunities like:</p>
<ul>
    <li>different subjects</li>
    <li>Average Calculation</li>
</ul>
<h1>Webpage</h1>
<p>The Webpage is an info page but also has an calculator</p>
<p>This Calculator only gives you the average of multiple numbers</p>
<h1>Mobile(Android)</h1>
<p>Because this project would be super cool to have on a Phone i decidet to develop one</p>
<p>I don't know if this will at sometime be on the Play Store</p>
<h1>API</h1>
<p>Soon i try working on an API that you can develop extensions</p>
<p>Maybe i'll implement a preset-function for subjects.</p>
